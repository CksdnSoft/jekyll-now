title: Introduction to Jekyll

It is 2020, and I want to keep a record of all the study notes that I will create as I study development or other CS topics.

I can't be bothered to create another website with databases. In addition, I don't want to pay any more money for running a server. I am already spending enough for other projects. So the option that I chose was to go with Jekyll, and host the website for free on Github Pages.
